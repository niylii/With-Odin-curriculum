      <h2>Pain and pleasure</h2>
      <p>No one <strong>rejects, dislikes or avoids</strong> pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely <strong>painful</strong>.</p>
      <p> Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and <strong>pain</strong> can procure him some great pleasure. </p>
      <p>To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes <strong>laborious physical</strong> exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>
