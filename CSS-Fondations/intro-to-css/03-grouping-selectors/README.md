I added unique class names to two elements and defined their shared and unique styles.

- **First element**: Black background, white text.
- **Second element**: Yellow background.

Both elements share a font size of 28px and use Helvetica, Times New Roman, and sans-serif as fallback fonts.

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check

- Does each element have a unique class name?
- Did you use the grouping selector for styles that both elements share?
- Did you make separate rules for the styles unique to each element?
