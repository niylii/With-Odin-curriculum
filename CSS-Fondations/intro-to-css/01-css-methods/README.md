In this exercise, I practiced adding CSS to an HTML file using external, internal, and inline methods. I used type selectors for external and internal CSS, and applied color keywords (like "blue") instead of RGB or HEX values.

I styled three elements, each demonstrating a different CSS method. Unlike other exercises, I created and linked the CSS file myself to focus on getting the syntax right. 
The properties you need to add to each element are:

* `div`: a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, center aligned, and bold
* `p`: a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px
* `button`: an orange background and a font size of 18px

### Self Check
- Did you use all three methods of adding CSS to an HTML file?
- Did you properly link the external CSS file in the HTML file?
- Does the `div` element have CSS added via the external method?
- Does the `p` element have CSS added via the internal method?
- Does the `button` element have CSS added via the inline method?
