Credits for the images in this exercise go to Katho Mutodo and Andrea Piacquadio.

In this exercise, I configured a partially completed HTML file to focus on chaining different selectors rather than just adding attributes. I styled two images, each with two class names, where one class is shared.

- **Element with both `avatar` and `proportioned` classes**: 
  - Width: 300 pixels 
  - Height: Retains original square proportions (no hardcoded pixel value).

- **Element with both `avatar` and `distorted` classes**: 
  - Width: 200 pixels 
  - Height: 400 pixels (hardcoded).

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check
- Did you properly chain class selectors for each rule?
- Does the `proportioned` image retain its original square proportions?
- Does the `distorted` image end up looking squished and, well, distorted?
